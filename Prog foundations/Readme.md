# Coffee Object
The Coffee Object is a JavaScript object that represents information about a cup of coffee. It is designed to be used in front-end web development projects where you need to manage and display data related to coffee beverages.

### String
String data types are used for representing various text values, including:

- Coffee types like `"Pumpkin Spice latte"`.
- Coffee sizes like `"Small"` and `"Grande"`.
- Messages like `"With milk."`.

### Number
Number data types are used for representing numeric values. For instance, the `espressoShots` property stores the number of espresso shots in the coffee, such as `"2"`.

### Boolean
Boolean data types are used to represent true/false values. The `sugar` property is a boolean indicating whether the coffee is sweetened (`true` or `false`).

### Array
Arrays are used to store lists of options. You can find arrays for different options like customer names (`customerNames`), coffee types (`coffeetypes`), coffee sizes (`coffeesize`), espresso shot amounts (`shotsamount`), and milk types (`milktype`). These arrays are used for random selection during coffee order creation.

### Function
A function named `serveCoffee(coffee)` is defined in the code. It takes a `coffee` object as a parameter and performs various actions, including displaying order details and messages. It demonstrates the use of functions for code organization and reusability.
